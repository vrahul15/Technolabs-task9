# 🏁 Codecademy Race Day Registration

Welcome to the **Race Day Registration** project!  
This program helps organize runners for Codecademy’s annual race by assigning race numbers and start times based on age and registration status.

## 🕒 Race Timeline

| Time      | Who Runs?                      |
|-----------|-------------------------------|
| **9:30am**  | Adults (over 18) who registered early |
| **11:00am** | Adults (over 18) who registered late  |
| **12:30pm** | All youth (under 18)                |

## 🚦 How It Works

- **Adults (over 18) who register early** get a race number **≥ 1000** and run at **9:30am**.
- **Adults (over 18) who register late** get a race number **< 1000** and run at **11:00am**.
- **Youth (under 18)** run at **12:30pm** (race number < 1000).
- **Runners exactly 18 years old** are asked to see the registration desk.
